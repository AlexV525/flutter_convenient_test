# [WIP] convenient_test

A fast, easy and reliable testing utility on top of integration_test, making writing tests as simple as speaking

[TODO write overview and intro]

[TODO it is based on `integration_test` and you can use *everything* of that, *plus* additional functionalities]

[TODO not only *write* tests more conventiently, but also *debug* them and *run* them more conveniently]

## Advantages

[TODO]

## Features

[TODO move *most interesting* features at top!]

### Write tests

Write less. Write it like speaking to a tester.

#### No more `pump`

[TODO Automatic wait and retry. no need to manually pump or wait. All done automatically.]

#### Fluent grammar

[TODO the more natural grammar]

#### Everything from `integration_test`

[TODO use *everything* - we expose the underlying `tester` so you can do anything with it]

### Debug tests faster

#### Time travel

[TODO explain it - command panel]

[TODO clearly see what steps are taken]

[TODO tap a step to see screenshots]

#### Videos & screenshots

[TODO when playing, auto highlight corresponding command entry]

[TODO and, screenshots]

[TODO explain: screenshot - "before" & "after" & ...]

[TODO explain: watch full video]

[TODO explain: watch video for a single test]

[TODO explain: open the video file and watch it using any player you like]

[TODO p.s. tests may execute too fast and you want to re-watch the process again]

#### Fast re-execution

[TODO Change tests quickly: change your test code, save it. then run it using one click. nothing more.]

#### Run selected tests

[TODO run one single test / a group of tests]

#### Interactive mode

[TODO only time of a hot restart. no need to recompile]

#### Visually see target regions

[TODO a. the Marks are explicitly drawn with indicator rects]

[TODO b. taps have visual feedbacks, can be seen in recorded video]

### Maintain tests

#### Flaky tests

[TODO e2e tests tend to be flaky sometimes. we auto retry and report. no need to be alermed by such false positives.]

[TODO also explicitly show which tests are flaky]

#### CI mode

[TODO explain]

### Misc

#### Raw logs

[TODO explain]

Thanks for testing frameworks in JavaScript, especially `Cypress`, for giving inspirations!
