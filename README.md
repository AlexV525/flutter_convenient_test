# [WIP] flutter_convenient_test

A fast, easy and reliable testing utility on top of integration_test, making writing tests as simple as speaking

[TODO write overview and intro]

[TODO it is based on `integration_test` and you can use *everything* of that, *plus* additional functionalities]

[TODO not only *write* tests more conventiently, but also *debug* them and *run* them more conveniently]

## Advantages

[TODO]

## Features

### Use everything from `integration_test`

[TODO]

[TODO use *everything* - we expose the underlying `tester` so you can do anything with it]

### Write tests fluently

[TODO the more natural grammar]

### Command panel

[TODO clearly see what steps are taken]

[TODO tap a step to see screenshots]

### Video records

[TODO]

### Screenshots

[TODO]

### Flaky tests

[TODO e2e tests tend to be flaky sometimes. we auto retry and report. no need to be alermed by such false positives.]

[TODO also explicitly show which tests are flaky]

### Raw logs

[TODO]

### Interactive mode

[TODO only time of a hot restart. no need to recompile]

### Run only selected tests

[TODO run one single test / a group of tests]

### Run test quickly

[TODO hot restart]

### Change tests quickly

[TODO change your test code, then click run in Manager, then it runs. no need to recompile.]

### Easy to set up

[TODO just run your app + run the manager (a normal Flutter app), nothing else]

### CI mode

[TODO]

### Visually see target regions

[TODO a. the Marks are explicitly drawn with indicator rects]

[TODO b. taps have visual feedbacks, can be seen in recorded video]

Thanks for testing frameworks in JavaScript, especially `Cypress`, for giving inspirations!
