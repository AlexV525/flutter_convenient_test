# [WIP] convenient_test

A fast, easy and reliable testing utility on top of integration_test, making writing tests as simple as speaking

[TODO write overview and intro]

[TODO it is based on `integration_test` and you can use *everything* of that, *plus* additional functionalities]

[TODO not only *write* tests more conventiently, but also *debug* them and *run* them more conveniently]

## Advantages

[TODO]

## Features

#### Time travel and action history...

[TODO explain it - command panel]

[TODO clearly see what steps are taken]

[TODO tap a step to see screenshots]

#### ... with videos and screenshots

[TODO when playing, auto highlight corresponding command entry]

[TODO and, screenshots]

[TODO explain: screenshot - "before" & "after" & ...]

[TODO explain: watch full video]

[TODO explain: watch video for a single test]

[TODO explain: open the video file and watch it using any player you like]

[TODO p.s. tests may execute too fast and you want to re-watch the process again]

#### Fluent grammar, no more `pump`

[TODO No more `pump`: Automatic wait and retry. no need to manually pump or wait. All done automatically.]

[TODO the more natural grammar]

#### Use everything from `integration_test`

[TODO use *everything* - we expose the underlying `tester` so you can do anything with it]

#### Rapidly re-execute after changing code

[TODO Change tests quickly: change your test code, save it. then run it using one click. nothing more.]

[TODO can run one single test / a group of tests. all in one click. no need to run all.]

#### Flaky tests tolerance

[TODO e2e tests tend to be flaky sometimes. we auto retry and report. no need to be alermed by such false positives. ]

[TODO also explicitly show which tests are flaky. report to you (unlike `test` which silently mark it as pass).]

#### Being interactive

[TODO only time of a hot restart. no need to recompile]

#### Visually see target regions

[TODO a. the Marks are explicitly drawn with indicator rects]

[TODO b. taps have visual feedbacks, can be seen in recorded video]

#### CI mode

[TODO explain]

#### Raw logs

Thanks for testing frameworks in JavaScript, especially `Cypress`, for giving inspirations!
